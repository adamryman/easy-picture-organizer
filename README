Easy Picture Sorter
========

Thank you Jhead for being awesome! Author: Matthias Wandel Site: http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/

Useage
------- 

Place jpg images with metadata into the same directory as the script and Jhead.

I had a lot of images with broken metadata, they were in a YYYY:MMDD:DD format. I wrote something to fix that but it is commented out by default.

Run the script and it will rename images in YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS format without overwriting images taken at the same time.

It will then sort them into folders by year and then month.

Have fun!
